0:00
mind mapping can be broken down into
0:01
three different levels of skill when
0:04
mind mapping is done at a skill level of
0:06
level three it's legitimately one of the
0:08
most powerful learning techniques that
0:10
you can Master it improves your memory
0:12
it increases your processing speed it
0:14
makes it easier to think about more
0:17
content more deeply but when mind
0:19
mapping is done at level one it can be a
0:22
complete waste of time for me being able
0:24
to do a level three mind map every time
0:27
is a big part of what gave me the
0:29
confidence to run a business full-time
0:31
while going through medical school and
0:33
then later my full-time Masters for
0:35
which I ranked first in my year now the
0:37
first step and actually being able to
0:39
level up your mind mapping is to be able
0:41
to look at a mind map and identify what
0:44
level it's at once we can figure out the
0:46
difference between the different levels
0:48
of mindmap we can then focus on the
0:49
processes that help us Bridge each of
0:52
these levels so I'll show you some
0:53
examples of each level of my maps see if
0:56
you can Spot the Difference so these
0:57
ones are level one
0:59
[Music]
Levels of mindmaps
1:02
and then these ones here are level
1:07
two and these are some level
1:16
three now you might think that the main
1:18
difference is that a level three mind
1:20
map just looks simpler or more
1:23
comprehensive but it is so much more
1:26
than that and the difference between a
1:27
level one and a level three is probably
1:30
the difference that separates a top 30%
1:33
learner from a top 1% learner but before
1:35
we get into that let's take a deep dive
1:37
into level one so here's the example of
1:39
the level one mind map again now the
1:43
level one mind map has two important
1:45
characteristics the first thing is that
1:48
it has
1:49
nonlinearity of ideas so if you have a
1:52
look at this you can see that it's not
1:54
just going left to right down the page
1:56
uh all of these things it's trying to
1:57
represent the ideas spatially around the
2:01
page and second thing is that there are
Level 1
2:03
connections between the ideas uh you can
2:06
see that they're trying to express these
2:08
connections with these lines and arrows
2:10
now the difference is actually a lot
2:11
more obvious when we go back a level to
2:14
what's even before level one which is
2:17
level zero note taking and level zero
2:20
note taking looks a little bit more like
2:23
this and these are actually my old notes
2:27
from like over 10 years ago go and I can
2:30
tell you that the thousands of hours I
2:33
spent on writing notes like these were
2:36
ultimately a waste of time so at level
2:38
zero there are five characteristics that
2:41
you should definitely avoid firstly it's
2:44
very linear uh secondly it's usually
2:47
very wordy and thirdly it's pretty
2:50
superficial uh it doesn't go into the
2:52
content very deeply it doesn't really
2:54
look at how ideas are related to each
2:56
other because frankly trying to write
2:58
that all down through level zero linear
3:00
note taking would be completely
3:02
overwhelming there's often a lot of
3:03
highlighting and sometimes there's a lot
3:05
of annotating and at the end of the day
3:07
it is uselessly timec consuming in that
3:09
it takes a lot of time but it's not
3:12
really helping with our retention or our
3:14
depth of understanding so level one
3:16
really represents this first point where
3:18
someone's trying to break this old
3:20
linear mold but the important thing is
3:23
not to just recognize the
3:25
characteristics of each level it's to
3:27
know what the process is that takes you
3:29
from level zero to level one and there
3:32
are three key
3:34
processes that someone is engaging in to
3:37
go from Level Zer to level one the first
3:39
process is that they're looking at how
3:42
they can use arrows and lines to
3:46
represent information instead of just
3:48
writing it out as full sentences so no
3:51
full
3:53
sentences the second thing is that we're
3:56
trying to cut down on how wordy it is
3:59
we're often doing a little bit more
4:03
summarizing and the third part is
4:06
getting a little bit more comfortable
4:08
with just representing information
4:11
spatially and without using
4:16
words when we follow these processes we
4:18
go from Level zero to level one now at
4:23
level one we're not really getting a
4:26
strong benefit from mindmapping the real
4:28
power of Mind mapping comes comes from
4:30
level two and level three and in fact
4:31
level one often looks pretty messy
4:35
however level one is not bad mind
4:39
mapping is a skill and like any other
4:41
skill there are levels to that skill and
4:43
you can't just skip a level level one is
4:47
necessary because it allows us to break
4:49
out from Level zero to then work towards
4:52
level two it's kind of like training
4:54
wheels on a bicycle and a lot of people
4:56
will say oh I gave mind mapping a go it
4:58
didn't really work for me but they
5:00
actually only reached level one and
5:02
you're right if you only reached level
5:04
one it's not really going to work for
5:05
you so let's have a look at level two
5:07
where you should see some benefit here's
5:09
an example of the level two mind maps
5:12
again and once we're at this level two
5:14
skill we should be feeling a lot more
5:17
comfortable with expressing information
5:19
nonlinearly and at level two there are
5:21
three characteristics to look out for
5:24
first of all we have groups of
5:26
information and these groups are related
5:29
to each other and as a result there is a
5:32
clearer flow or structure to the
Level 2
5:35
information you can see these groups
5:38
being represented uh here in the brown
5:41
uh as well as the flow of information
5:43
with the arrows being a little bit
5:45
cleaner and if your mind map has these
5:47
characteristics it's probably at level
5:50
two and by the way let me know what
5:52
level you are in the comments so that I
5:54
can help cater my future videos to you
5:56
so now that we know what a level two
5:58
mind map looks like let's think about
6:00
what the processes are that take us from
6:03
level one to level two there are again
6:06
three main processes that we want to
6:09
focus on here the first one is that
6:11
we're thinking a little bit more about
6:14
how ideas are similar or different to
6:17
each
6:21
other and by thinking about how similar
6:23
things are to each other this allows us
6:25
to put them into groups we're arranging
6:27
them by those similar ities number two
6:30
we're now thinking about how the
6:32
information actually
6:34
flows and influences each
6:38
other we've created these groups we've
6:41
looked at how things might be related
6:42
and similar to each other and we're
6:43
thinking how do these ideas connect
6:46
together in a coherent structure which
6:48
leads to number three we're actually
6:50
thinking about
6:52
intentionally creating more of a
6:57
structure as opposed to for example just
6:59
drawing a bunch of lines and arrows
7:01
connecting things all over the place and
7:03
overall the the difference between level
7:05
one and level two the major difference
7:07
is that we're spending a lot more time
7:10
thinking about how we want to arrange
7:13
the information and organize it as
7:15
opposed to just getting used to
7:17
organizing it nonlinearly and by
7:20
thinking about how to organize the
7:22
information in level two and later also
7:25
in level three we're forcing our brain
7:27
to engage in that higher order think
7:29
which is one of the most important
7:32
cognitive processes that you can do to
7:35
understand remember and apply what you
7:37
learned properly in fact the oecd has
7:41
even come out with a statement saying
7:42
that higher order thinking skills is one
7:45
of the most crucial things that a
7:48
modernday learner needs to know to be
7:51
successful so what that means is that if
7:53
you are mindmapping and you're not
7:55
noticing improvements in your
7:57
understanding or your memory or your
7:58
ability to apply the information it
8:00
probably means that you're not engaging
8:03
at that higher order of thinking and
8:06
that would be common because most people
8:10
tend to avoid higher order thinking
8:13
since it takes more mental effort and it
8:15
can feel uncomfortable which basically
8:17
means most people are avoiding the type
8:20
of thinking that helps build stronger
8:23
memory and deeper understanding in the
8:25
first place this is famously called the
8:27
misinterpreted iFit hypothesis which
8:28
I've talked about in lots of my other
8:30
videos and this is important because
8:31
there's essentially no point in using
8:33
mind mapping as a technique if we're not
8:36
engaging in the right type of thinking
8:38
and it's actually really easy to
8:40
demonstrate the difference between level
8:43
zero level one and level two so I'll
8:46
show you using this article on
8:48
metacognition which is just taken from
8:50
Wikipedia it could be from a textbook or
8:52
from lecture slides uh it doesn't really
8:53
matter this is just a demonstration so
8:55
at level zero let me show you what my
8:58
note taking would look like I'll type it
9:00
out for you so you don't have to
9:01
struggle reading through my handwriting
9:03
so as I'm running these notes all I'm
9:04
doing is I'm reading a sentence I'm
9:07
summarizing it a little I'm transcribing
9:09
it down honestly I may as well have just
9:11
used chat gbt or something to do this
9:13
because it takes no mental effort and my
9:16
brain is almost asleep uh no real
9:20
learning is happening in the
9:22
brain now there actually is a way to
9:25
still do linear notes while still
9:28
getting level three results uh and I'll
9:31
show you that one later okay so I'll
9:34
just end that demonstration there
9:35
because I'm losing brain Styles let me
9:37
do the same passage at level
9:43
one and so here as I'm writing I'm
9:45
mentally doing the same thing I'm
9:47
basically just reading a sentence I'm
9:49
summarizing it a little uh maybe a
9:52
little bit more concisely and then I'm
9:53
just writing it down and I'm basically
9:56
just looking to see if it's connect to
9:59
anything else really obviously and I'm
10:02
putting some lines and arrows
10:04
down as we are progressing you can see
10:08
it's starting to get a little messy and
10:12
honestly like it's already kind of
10:14
overwhelming in terms of just there's a
10:16
lot of lines and arrows going everywhere
10:19
um and this is usually when a lot of
10:20
students will say it's not working since
10:22
it might actually feel worse than just
10:24
linear nodes which were at least easier
10:26
to read but anyway that was level one
10:30
same content same stuff but done through
10:33
level one mind mapping and you can see
10:35
some similarities with the examples that
10:36
I showed you before so now let's do
10:38
level two exactly the same content again
10:42
now here there's a big difference in
10:44
thinking compared to before because
10:46
instead of just going sentence by
10:48
sentence and putting it down I'm
10:49
actually uh reading more I'm actually
10:52
thinking about it back and forth I'm
10:54
actively deciding how I want to
10:56
structure this information in a way that
10:59
makes sense and I'm also actively trying
11:01
to group related ideas together you can
11:03
see it's looking tidier it's there's
11:06
more groups it's a little bit easier to
11:08
follow and it's actually a lot more
11:09
engaging in fact it's actually even a
11:12
little bit fun and I can feel that the
11:14
information uh sticks in my head a lot
11:17
more easily while at level zero and then
11:19
level one I barely remember what I wrote
11:22
down uh also it's a little hard to see
11:23
from the video but the time I spent just
11:26
thinking about what to write before even
11:29
writing anything down in the first place
11:31
is a lot longer so at level zero and
11:33
level one I'm I'm basically writing
11:35
something every 5 or 10 seconds I'm
11:37
pretty much writing Non-Stop and at
11:39
level two I'm thinking about things for
11:41
like you know 20 or 30 seconds or even
11:44
more before even writing it down because
11:46
I'm just trying to think about how I
11:48
want to arrange it that's actually um
11:51
one really good way to see if you're
11:53
thinking about things enough to learn
11:55
effectively it shouldn't really be
11:58
possible to think at level two depth and
12:02
also write constantly so that is level
12:06
two and now going from Level zero to
12:08
level two is probably enough to give you
12:11
a decent little grade bump of like 10 to
12:14
15% but level three is where you start
12:17
seeing some serious improvements now
12:20
before we go into what a level three
12:22
mind map looks like I just want to
12:23
preface by saying that my mapping is a
12:26
complex skill it took me like over a
12:29
decade of trial and error and reading
12:32
research to really Master it and I'm
12:34
glad that I did because I'm able to save
12:36
time for you uh with videos like these
12:39
but what about other skills that are not
12:41
mind mapping brilliant question and
12:43
Brilliant is the answer brilliant is a
12:46
sponsor of today's video and it is where
12:47
you learn by doing you learn by
12:50
experimenting solving problems making
12:52
mistakes and learning from them there
12:55
have thousands of interactive lessons on
12:57
subjects like data analysis math math
12:59
programming and AI brilliant helps you
13:01
to build knowledge that you can learn
13:03
and then apply within minutes you can
13:05
also fit it in whenever you've got time
13:07
which helps to build a habit of learning
13:08
something useful every single day and
13:10
their Hands-On problem solving approach
13:12
makes it much faster and more fun than
13:15
the traditional boring old lesson it's
13:17
an opportunity to train your critical
13:19
thinking and real world problem solving
13:22
skills which are part of those crucial
13:24
higher order thinking skills that I
13:27
mentioned earlier as opposed to the
13:29
normal kind of pointless memorization
13:31
which is very lower order brilliant has
13:34
recently launched a bunch of new lessons
13:36
on data analysis and probability which
13:39
is a subject that I'm personally pretty
13:41
interested about it uses real world data
13:43
and trains you on how to find Trends to
13:46
make better decisions it's perfect for
13:47
Learners at any level and you also get
13:50
to see the real data from companies like
13:53
Starbucks X and Spotify to try
13:55

that link now let's dive back into the
14:09
level three mind maps which is where the
14:11
real power of mind maps comes in here's
14:14
an example of my maps at level three
14:16
again and there are three
14:18
characteristics that you need to know uh
14:21
at level three the first thing is that
14:23
the structure and flow is much clearer
14:26
you can clearly see uh where where the
14:29
information is going throughout this map
14:32
number two there's more emphasis to some
14:34
groups and arrows over others for
Level 3
14:37
example you can see that these arrows
14:39
are a little bit thicker compared to for
14:40
example these arrows that visually
14:42
indicates the importance of information
14:44
and relationships and this last one is
14:47
harder to notice but the groups
14:49
themselves are more intuitive and easier
14:53
to remember so if we kind of zoom in a
14:55
little bit here we can see that the
14:57
actual name of the the groups that have
14:59
been used are not always the same
15:02
terminology that is taught for the topic
15:05
they've actually relabeled the group so
15:07
it makes more sense for them at an
15:09
intuitive level it's actually easier to
15:12
understand the difference between level
15:13
two and three by talking about the
15:15
processes that we need to engage in to
15:18
go from level two to level three now by
15:21
the time we're at a level three skill
15:23
we're used to writing nonlinear notes
15:26
we're used to thinking about how things
15:28
are similar we're used to grouping
15:30
things together we're used to creating
15:32
structures and flows what we're focusing
15:34
on with the process at level three is
15:37
the quality so we're improving the
15:39
quality of the connections and
15:42
relationships that we're forming we're
15:43
also increasing the quality and when I
15:46
say quality I'm talking about how
15:48
intuitive the groups that we're forming
15:51
are yeah sure we can connect this group
15:54
to this group we can connect these ideas
15:56
to these other ideas we can group these
15:58
things together sure but which way of
16:02
grouping is actually the best for us
16:06
which makes the most sense which is the
16:08
most intuitive which feels like it's
16:10
going to be stickier in our memory which
16:12
means number three we have to spend time
16:15
to identify Alternatives and then make
16:18
an actual judgment on which one is the
16:22
best for example here's that little map
16:24
that I made before at level two and then
16:27
here is the exact same map with
16:30
essentially the exact same information
16:32
but just grouped and structured
16:35
differently so at level three I'm
16:37
actually thinking about these
16:39
alternative ways of structuring the
16:41
information and arranging them in a way
16:43
that makes more sense to me at level
16:45
three our mind maps are becoming cleaner
16:48
more intuitive more deliberate the lines
16:51
and the arrows and everything that I'm
16:53
putting on there is more intentional now
16:55
for most people the difference between
16:57
level two and level three
16:59
uh may not seem like much after all
17:01
we're still just grouping and organizing
17:03
information but the difference between
17:06
level two and level three in terms of
17:08
how much it affects your performance and
17:10
results and memory and depth of
17:12
understanding is probably more than the
17:15
difference between going from Level zero
17:18
all the way through to level two being
17:20
able to create a level three mind map
17:23
consistently is very uncommon and
17:26
probably translates to aough L top 10%
17:30
level of performance in fact the type of
17:34
thinking that you have to do for a level
17:36
three mind map is so crucial that
17:39
virtually any top 1 or 2% learner is
17:42
going to be thinking in this way even if
17:45
they're not using mind maps as the
17:47
technique mentally they're engaging in
17:51
those same higher order thinking
17:53
processes and patterns which is why
17:55
earlier I said that it is actually
17:57
possible to do level zero uh linear note
18:01
taking but still get level three types
18:05
of results and let me show you how so
18:08
just going back to my article on
18:10
metacognition here I'm going to do the
18:12
like pseudo level three note taking with
18:14
linear notes uh here so as I do this
18:17
just notice how I'm spending a lot of
18:19
time reading and um and when I'm writing
18:22
I'm not actually just reading things and
18:25
writing things down I'm actually
18:27
thinking about it and synthesizing it
18:29
and I'm doing all of that higher order
18:30
thinking and grouping and thinking about
18:32
how things are related to each other I'm
18:33
doing that all mentally as I read and
18:35
then I'm writing down like my entire
Putting it all together
18:37
synthesis and structure so it's almost
18:40
like a mini essay where I'm trying to
18:42
explain all the relationships and
18:43
nuances of the content that I've read
18:46
and this is basically how you're able to
18:48
get some people that are using what
18:50
seems like a pretty mediocre method of
18:53
note taking but they're getting great
18:54
results because mentally what's going on
18:56
is at a high level but there are two
18:58
specific reasons that you should not do
19:01
this first of all it's honestly just
19:04
much harder than doing the level three
19:07
mind map because I'm having to do all
19:08
the thinking in my head and all the
19:10
processing I can't track my thoughts and
19:13
uh all the relationships that I'm
19:15
thinking of on the mindmap so it's much
19:19
much harder for me to actually create
19:21
the connections and organize my thoughts
19:23
being able to just literally write it
19:26
down and brainstorm the ideas as I I go
19:29
uh is probably two or even three times
19:32
faster and easier than trying to do it
19:35
all mentally and then just forcing it
19:37
back down into a linear set of notes
19:39
again this is actually also the reason
19:40
why you should use mind maps to plan uh
19:43
literature reviews and essays it's also
19:46
probably two or three times more time
19:49
consuming overall not just when I'm
19:53
writing the notes but later when I go to
19:55
review the notes I'm forcing myself to
19:57
have to read through this entire thing
20:00
all over again to extract the the
20:03
meaning from it whereas if I had just
20:05
the Mind map I can just glance at it to
20:08
review the structure in like seconds or
20:11
minutes and even though the Mind map
20:12
looks simpler it's actually the same
20:16
types of relationships and thoughts that
20:19
as were in the essay the essay is not a
20:22
more comprehensive set of notes at all
20:26
in fact the essay probably doesn't even
20:29
cover all of the relationships that I'd
20:31
be able to express in the mindmap the
20:34
level three mind map is
20:36
incomparably simpler faster and more
20:40
organized this synthesized essay writing
20:42
thing that I just did you can use that
20:44
as a revision technique later instead
20:47
now if you found this video and you want
20:49
even more to help you master the Art and
20:52
Science of learning then I've got a free
20:55
Weekly Newsletter that I've created
20:57
where I've taken my decade of coaching
21:00
and distilled what really works into
21:03
bite-sized emails each email contains a
21:05
key concept to help you improve your
21:07
memory your depth of understanding your
21:09
ability to apply your knowledge as well
21:12
as a practical takeaway or a challenge
21:14
it's completely free and the concepts
21:16
that I talked about in this video are
21:18
also included in one of those
21:19
newsletters as well as other Concepts
21:21
that I have never made any videos about
21:23
if you're interested I'll leave a link
21:24
for you to join that in the description
21:26
