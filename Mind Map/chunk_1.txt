0:00 mind mapping can be broken down into 0:01 three different levels of skill when 0:04 mind mapping is done at a skill level of 0:06 level three it's legitimately one of the 0:08 most powerful learning techniques that 0:10 you can Master it improves your memory 0:12 it increases your processing speed it 0:14 makes it easier to think about more 0:17 content more deeply but when mind 0:19 mapping is done at level one it can be a 0:22 complete waste of time for me being able 0:24 to do a level three mind map every time 0:27 is a big part of what gave me the 0:29 confidence to run a business full-time 0:31 while going through medical school and 0:33 then later my full-time Masters for 0:35 which I ranked first in my year now the 0:37 first step and actually being able to 0:39 level up your mind mapping is to be able 0:41 to look at a mind map and identify what 0:44 level it's at once we can figure out the 0:46 difference between the different levels 0:48 of mindmap we can then focus on the 0:49 processes that help us Bridge each of 0:52 these levels so I'll show you some 0:53 examples of each level of my maps see if 0:56 you can Spot the Difference so these 0:57 ones are level one 0:59 [Music] Levels of mindmaps 1:02 and then these ones here are level 1:07 two and these are some level 1:16 three now you might think that the main 1:18 difference is that a level three mind 1:20 map just looks simpler or more 1:23 comprehensive but it is so much more 1:26 than that and the difference between a 1:27 level one and a level three is probably 1:30 the difference that separates a top 30% 1:33 learner from a top 1% learner but before 1:35 we get into that let's take a deep dive 1:37 into level one so here's the example of 1:39 the level one mind map again now the 1:43 level one mind map has two important 1:45 characteristics the first thing is that 1:48 it has 1:49 nonlinearity of ideas so if you have a 1:52 look at this you can see that it's not 1:54 just going left to right down the page 1:56 uh all of these things it's trying to 1:57 represent the ideas spatially around the 2:01 page and second thing is that there are Level 1 2:03 connections between the ideas uh you can 2:06 see that they're trying to express these 2:08 connections with these lines and arrows 2:10 now the difference is actually a lot 2:11 more obvious when we go back a level to 2:14 what's even before level one which is 2:17 level zero note taking and level zero 2:20 note taking looks a little bit more like 2:23 this and these are actually my old notes 2:27 from like over 10 years ago go and I can 2:30 tell you that the thousands of hours I 2:33 spent on writing notes like these were 2:36 ultimately a waste of time so at level 2:38 zero there are five characteristics that 2:41 you should definitely avoid firstly it's 2:44 very linear uh secondly it's usually 2:47 very wordy and thirdly it's pretty 2:50 superficial uh it doesn't go into the 2:52 content very deeply it doesn't really 2:54 look at how ideas are related to each 2:56 other because frankly trying to write 2:58 that all down through level zero linear 3:00 note taking would be completely 3:02 overwhelming there's often a lot of 3:03 highlighting and sometimes there's a lot 3:05 of annotating and at the end of the day 3:07 it is uselessly timec consuming in that 3:09 it takes a lot of time but it's not 3:12 really helping with our retention or our 3:14 depth of understanding so level one 3:16 really represents this first point where 3:18 someone's trying to break this old 3:20 linear mold but the important thing is 3:23 not to just recognize the 3:25 characteristics of each level it's to 3:27 know what the process is that takes you 3:29 from level zero to level one and there 3:32 are three key 3:34 processes that someone is engaging in to 3:37 go from Level Zer to level one the first 3:39 process is that they're looking at how 3:42 they can use arrows and lines to 3:46 represent information instead of just 3:48 writing it out as full sentences so no 3:51 full 3:53 sentences the second thing is that we're 3:56 trying to cut down on how wordy it is 3:59 we're often doing a little bit more 4:03 summarizing and the third part is 4:06 getting a little bit more comfortable 4:08 with just representing information 4:11 spatially and without using 4:16 words when we follow these processes we 4:18 go from Level zero to level one now at 4:23 level one we're not really getting a 4:26 strong benefit from mindmapping the real 4:28 power of Mind mapping comes comes from 4:30 level two and level three and in fact 4:31 level one often looks pretty messy 4:35 however level one is not bad mind 4:39 mapping is a skill and like any other 4:41 skill there are levels to that skill and 4:43 you can't just skip a level level one is 4:47 necessary because it allows us to break 4:49 out from Level zero to then work towards 4:52 level two it's kind of like training 4:54 wheels on a bicycle and a lot of people 4:56 will say oh I gave mind mapping a go it 4:58 didn't really work for me but they 5:00 actually only reached level one and 5:02 you're right if you only reached level 5:04 one it's not really going to work for 5:05 you so let's have a look at level two 5:07 where you should see some benefit here's 5:09 an example of the level two mind maps 5:12 again and once we're at this level two 5:14 skill we should be feeling a lot more 5:17 comfortable with expressing information 5:19 nonlinearly and at level two there are 5:21 three characteristics to look out for 5:24 first of all we have groups of 5:26 information and these groups are related 5:29 to each other and as a result there is a 5:32 clearer flow or structure to the Level 2 5:35 information you can see these groups 5:38 being represented uh here in the brown 5:41 uh as well as the flow of information 5:43 with the arrows being a little bit 5:45 cleaner and if your mind map has these 5:47 characteristics it's probably at level 5:50 two and by the way let me know what 5:52 level you are in the comments so that I 5:54 can help cater my future videos to you 5:56 so now that we know what a level two 5:58 mind map looks like let's think about 6:00 what the processes are that take us from 6:03 level one to level two there are again 6:06 three main processes that we want to 6:09 focus on here the first one is that 6:11 we're thinking a little bit more about 6:14 how ideas are similar or different to 6:17 each 6:21 other and by thinking about how similar 6:23 things are to each other this allows us 6:25 to put them into groups we're arranging 6:27 them by those similar ities number two 6:30 we're now thinking about how the 6:32 information actually 6:34 flows and influences each 6:38 other we've created these groups we've 6:41 looked at how things might be related 6:42 and similar to each other and we're 6:43 thinking how do these ideas connect 6:46 together in a coherent structure which 6:48 leads to number three we're actually 6:50 thinking about 6:52 intentionally creating more of a 6:57 structure as opposed to for example just 6:59 drawing a bunch of lines and arrows 7:01 connecting things all over the place and 7:03 overall the the difference between level 7:05 one and level two the major difference 7:07 is that we're spending a lot more time 7:10 thinking about how we want to arrange 7:13 the information and organize it as 7:15 opposed to just getting used to 7:17 organizing it nonlinearly and by 7:20 thinking about how to organize the 7:22 information in level two and later also 7:25 in level three we're forcing our brain 7:27 to engage in that higher order think 7:29 which is one of the most important 7:32 cognitive processes that you can do to 7:35 understand remember and apply what you 7:37 learned properly in fact the oecd has 7:41 even come out with a statement saying 7:42 that higher order thinking skills is one 7:45 of the most crucial things that a 7:48 modernday learner needs to know to be 7:51 successful so what that means is that if 7:53 you are mindmapping and you're not 7:55 noticing improvements in your 7:57 understanding or your memory or your 7:58 ability to apply the information it 8:00 probably means that you're not engaging 8:03 at that higher order of thinking and 8:06 that would be common because most people 8:10 tend to avoid higher order thinking 8:13 since it takes more mental effort and it 8:15 can feel uncomfortable which basically 8:17 means most people are avoiding the type 8:20 of thinking that helps build stronger 8:23 memory and deeper understanding in the 8:25 first place this is famously called the 8:27 misinterpreted iFit hypothesis which 8:28 I've talked about in lots of my other 8:30 videos and this is important because 8:31 there's essentially no point in using 8:33 mind mapping as a technique if we're not 8:36 engaging in the right type of thinking 8:38 and it's actually really easy to 8:40 demonstrate the difference between level 8:43 zero
