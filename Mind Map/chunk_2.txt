level one and level two so I'll 8:46 show you using this article on 8:48 metacognition which is just taken from 8:50 Wikipedia it could be from a textbook or 8:52 from lecture slides uh it doesn't really 8:53 matter this is just a demonstration so 8:55 at level zero let me show you what my 8:58 note taking would look like I'll type it 9:00 out for you so you don't have to 9:01 struggle reading through my handwriting 9:03 so as I'm running these notes all I'm 9:04 doing is I'm reading a sentence I'm 9:07 summarizing it a little I'm transcribing 9:09 it down honestly I may as well have just 9:11 used chat gbt or something to do this 9:13 because it takes no mental effort and my 9:16 brain is almost asleep uh no real 9:20 learning is happening in the 9:22 brain now there actually is a way to 9:25 still do linear notes while still 9:28 getting level three results uh and I'll 9:31 show you that one later okay so I'll 9:34 just end that demonstration there 9:35 because I'm losing brain Styles let me 9:37 do the same passage at level 9:43 one and so here as I'm writing I'm 9:45 mentally doing the same thing I'm 9:47 basically just reading a sentence I'm 9:49 summarizing it a little uh maybe a 9:52 little bit more concisely and then I'm 9:53 just writing it down and I'm basically 9:56 just looking to see if it's connect to 9:59 anything else really obviously and I'm 10:02 putting some lines and arrows 10:04 down as we are progressing you can see 10:08 it's starting to get a little messy and 10:12 honestly like it's already kind of 10:14 overwhelming in terms of just there's a 10:16 lot of lines and arrows going everywhere 10:19 um and this is usually when a lot of 10:20 students will say it's not working since 10:22 it might actually feel worse than just 10:24 linear nodes which were at least easier 10:26 to read but anyway that was level one 10:30 same content same stuff but done through 10:33 level one mind mapping and you can see 10:35 some similarities with the examples that 10:36 I showed you before so now let's do 10:38 level two exactly the same content again 10:42 now here there's a big difference in 10:44 thinking compared to before because 10:46 instead of just going sentence by 10:48 sentence and putting it down I'm 10:49 actually uh reading more I'm actually 10:52 thinking about it back and forth I'm 10:54 actively deciding how I want to 10:56 structure this information in a way that 10:59 makes sense and I'm also actively trying 11:01 to group related ideas together you can 11:03 see it's looking tidier it's there's 11:06 more groups it's a little bit easier to 11:08 follow and it's actually a lot more 11:09 engaging in fact it's actually even a 11:12 little bit fun and I can feel that the 11:14 information uh sticks in my head a lot 11:17 more easily while at level zero and then 11:19 level one I barely remember what I wrote 11:22 down uh also it's a little hard to see 11:23 from the video but the time I spent just 11:26 thinking about what to write before even 11:29 writing anything down in the first place 11:31 is a lot longer so at level zero and 11:33 level one I'm I'm basically writing 11:35 something every 5 or 10 seconds I'm 11:37 pretty much writing Non-Stop and at 11:39 level two I'm thinking about things for 11:41 like you know 20 or 30 seconds or even 11:44 more before even writing it down because 11:46 I'm just trying to think about how I 11:48 want to arrange it that's actually um 11:51 one really good way to see if you're 11:53 thinking about things enough to learn 11:55 effectively it shouldn't really be 11:58 possible to think at level two depth and 12:02 also write constantly so that is level 12:06 two and now going from Level zero to 12:08 level two is probably enough to give you 12:11 a decent little grade bump of like 10 to 12:14 15% but level three is where you start 12:17 seeing some serious improvements now 12:20 before we go into what a level three 12:22 mind map looks like I just want to 12:23 preface by saying that my mapping is a 12:26 complex skill it took me like over a 12:29 decade of trial and error and reading 12:32 research to really Master it and I'm 12:34 glad that I did because I'm able to save 12:36 time for you uh with videos like these 12:39 but what about other skills that are not 12:41 mind mapping brilliant question and 12:43 Brilliant is the answer brilliant is a 12:46 sponsor of today's video and it is where 12:47 you learn by doing you learn by 12:50 experimenting solving problems making 12:52 mistakes and learning from them there 12:55 have thousands of interactive lessons on 12:57 subjects like data analysis math math 12:59 programming and AI brilliant helps you 13:01 to build knowledge that you can learn 13:03 and then apply within minutes you can 13:05 also fit it in whenever you've got time 13:07 which helps to build a habit of learning 13:08 something useful every single day and 13:10 their Hands-On problem solving approach 13:12 makes it much faster and more fun than 13:15 the traditional boring old lesson it's 13:17 an opportunity to train your critical 13:19 thinking and real world problem solving 13:22 skills which are part of those crucial 13:24 higher order thinking skills that I 13:27 mentioned earlier as opposed to the 13:29 normal kind of pointless memorization 13:31 which is very lower order brilliant has 13:34 recently launched a bunch of new lessons 13:36 on data analysis and probability which 13:39 is a subject that I'm personally pretty 13:41 interested about it uses real world data 13:43 and trains you on how to find Trends to 13:46 make better decisions it's perfect for 13:47 Learners at any level and you also get 13:50 to see the real data from companies like 13:53 Starbucks X and Spotify to try 13:55 everything that brilliant has to offer 13:56 for free for a full 30 days go to 13:59 brilliant.org 14:01 jusung or click the link in the 14:03 description you'll also get 20% off an 14:05 annual premium subscription if you use 14:07 that link now let's dive back into the 14:09 level three mind maps which is where the 14:11 real power of mind maps comes in here's 14:14 an example of my maps at level three 14:16 again and there are three 14:18 characteristics that you need to know uh 14:21 at level three the first thing is that 14:23 the structure and flow is much clearer 14:26 you can clearly see uh where where the 14:29 information is going throughout this map 14:32 number two there's more emphasis to some 14:34 groups and arrows over others for Level 3 14:37 example you can see that these arrows 14:39 are a little bit thicker compared to for 14:40 example these arrows that visually 14:42 indicates the importance of information 14:44 and relationships and this last one is 14:47 harder to notice but the groups 14:49 themselves are more intuitive and easier 14:53 to remember so if we kind of zoom in a 14:55 little bit here we can see that the 14:57 actual name of the the groups that have 14:59 been used are not always the same 15:02 terminology that is taught for the topic 15:05 they've actually relabeled the group so 15:07 it makes more sense for them at an 15:09 intuitive level it's actually easier to 15:12 understand the difference between level 15:13 two and three by talking about the 15:15 processes that we need to engage in to 15:18 go from level two to level three now by 15:21 the time we're at a level three skill 15:23 we're used to writing nonlinear notes 15:26 we're used to thinking about how things 15:28 are similar we're used to grouping 15:30 things together we're used to creating 15:32 structures and flows what we're focusing 15:34 on with the process at level three is 15:37 the quality so we're improving the 15:39 quality of the connections and 15:42 relationships that we're forming we're 15:43 also increasing the quality and when I 15:46 say quality I'm talking about how 15:48 intuitive the groups that we're forming 15:51 are yeah sure we can connect this group 15:54 to this group we can connect these ideas 15:56 to these other ideas we can group these 15:58 things together sure but which way of 16:02 grouping is actually the best for us 16:06 which makes the most sense which is the 16:08 most intuitive which feels like it's 16:10 going to be stickier in our memory which 16:12 means number three we have to spend time 16:15 to identify Alternatives and then make 16:18 an actual judgment on which one is the 16:22 best for example here's that little map 16:24 that I made before at level two and then 16:27 here is the exact same map with 16:30 essentially the exact same information 16:32 but just grouped and structured 16:35 differently so at level three I'm 16:37 actually thinking about these 16:39 alternative ways of structuring the 16:41 information and arranging them in a way 16:43 that makes more sense to me at level 16:45 three our mind maps are becoming cleaner 16:48 more intuitive more deliberate the lines 16:51 and the arrows and
