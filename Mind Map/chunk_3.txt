everything that I'm 16:53 putting on there is more intentional now 16:55 for most people the difference between 16:57 level two and level three 16:59 uh may not seem like much after all 17:01 we're still just grouping and organizing 17:03 information but the difference between 17:06 level two and level three in terms of 17:08 how much it affects your performance and 17:10 results and memory and depth of 17:12 understanding is probably more than the 17:15 difference between going from Level zero 17:18 all the way through to level two being 17:20 able to create a level three mind map 17:23 consistently is very uncommon and 17:26 probably translates to aough L top 10% 17:30 level of performance in fact the type of 17:34 thinking that you have to do for a level 17:36 three mind map is so crucial that 17:39 virtually any top 1 or 2% learner is 17:42 going to be thinking in this way even if 17:45 they're not using mind maps as the 17:47 technique mentally they're engaging in 17:51 those same higher order thinking 17:53 processes and patterns which is why 17:55 earlier I said that it is actually 17:57 possible to do level zero uh linear note 18:01 taking but still get level three types 18:05 of results and let me show you how so 18:08 just going back to my article on 18:10 metacognition here I'm going to do the 18:12 like pseudo level three note taking with 18:14 linear notes uh here so as I do this 18:17 just notice how I'm spending a lot of 18:19 time reading and um and when I'm writing 18:22 I'm not actually just reading things and 18:25 writing things down I'm actually 18:27 thinking about it and synthesizing it 18:29 and I'm doing all of that higher order 18:30 thinking and grouping and thinking about 18:32 how things are related to each other I'm 18:33 doing that all mentally as I read and 18:35 then I'm writing down like my entire Putting it all together 18:37 synthesis and structure so it's almost 18:40 like a mini essay where I'm trying to 18:42 explain all the relationships and 18:43 nuances of the content that I've read 18:46 and this is basically how you're able to 18:48 get some people that are using what 18:50 seems like a pretty mediocre method of 18:53 note taking but they're getting great 18:54 results because mentally what's going on 18:56 is at a high level but there are two 18:58 specific reasons that you should not do 19:01 this first of all it's honestly just 19:04 much harder than doing the level three 19:07 mind map because I'm having to do all 19:08 the thinking in my head and all the 19:10 processing I can't track my thoughts and 19:13 uh all the relationships that I'm 19:15 thinking of on the mindmap so it's much 19:19 much harder for me to actually create 19:21 the connections and organize my thoughts 19:23 being able to just literally write it 19:26 down and brainstorm the ideas as I I go 19:29 uh is probably two or even three times 19:32 faster and easier than trying to do it 19:35 all mentally and then just forcing it 19:37 back down into a linear set of notes 19:39 again this is actually also the reason 19:40 why you should use mind maps to plan uh 19:43 literature reviews and essays it's also 19:46 probably two or three times more time 19:49 consuming overall not just when I'm 19:53 writing the notes but later when I go to 19:55 review the notes I'm forcing myself to 19:57 have to read through this entire thing 20:00 all over again to extract the the 20:03 meaning from it whereas if I had just 20:05 the Mind map I can just glance at it to 20:08 review the structure in like seconds or 20:11 minutes and even though the Mind map 20:12 looks simpler it's actually the same 20:16 types of relationships and thoughts that 20:19 as were in the essay the essay is not a 20:22 more comprehensive set of notes at all 20:26 in fact the essay probably doesn't even 20:29 cover all of the relationships that I'd 20:31 be able to express in the mindmap the 20:34 level three mind map is 20:36 incomparably simpler faster and more 20:40 organized this synthesized essay writing 20:42 thing that I just did you can use that 20:44 as a revision technique later instead 20:47 now if you found this video and you want 20:49 even more to help you master the Art and 20:52 Science of learning then I've got a free 20:55 Weekly Newsletter that I've created 20:57 where I've taken my decade of coaching 21:00 and distilled what really works into 21:03 bite-sized emails each email contains a 21:05 key concept to help you improve your 21:07 memory your depth of understanding your 21:09 ability to apply your knowledge as well 21:12 as a practical takeaway or a challenge 21:14 it's completely free and the concepts 21:16 that I talked about in this video are 21:18 also included in one of those 21:19 newsletters as well as other Concepts 21:21 that I have never made any videos about 21:23 if you're interested I'll leave a link 21:24 for you to join that in the description 21:26 thank you so much for watching and I'll 21:28 see you in the next one
